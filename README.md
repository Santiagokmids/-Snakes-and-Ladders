* Descripci√≥n / Description:

Snakes and ladders is a famous board game, in which the objective is to get your token to the last position on the game board. Each player has a token, which is differentiated by a symbol, and for this position to advance on the game board, he must roll a dice to determine how many positions the player who rolled the dice will advance.

Throughout the game board you can find objects that can be of help or of disadvantage for a player. Stairs on the game board cause a player to climb from one position to another as long as he has landed at the beginning of a staircase. On the other hand, there are snakes, which lower a player's position whenever he lands on a snake's head or final position.

The first player to reach or cross the last position on the game board is the winner and can save their score in the winners table, which is a table where all those players who have won are saved, each with their respective score, from best score to worst score.

The game can be simulated if the user wants it, it can be canceled and the information of the game board can also be seen when the user wishes.
