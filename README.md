* Descripci√≥n / Description:

Snakes and ladders is a famous board game, in which the last objective is to get your token to the position of the game board. Each player has a token, which is differentiated by means of a symbol, and in order for this position to advance on the game board, he will have to roll a dice to determine how many positions the player who rolled the dice will advance.

Throughout the game board you can find objects that can be of help or of disadvantage for a player. Stairs on the game board cause a player to climb from one position to another as long as the player has landed at the beginning of a staircase. On the other hand, there are the snakes, which lower a player's position as long as he falls on the head or final position of a snake.

The first player to reach or cross the last position on the game board is the winner and can save his score in the winners table.
